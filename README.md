# lotto - lottery numbers quick picker based on radioactive decay random data

Cloned from: https://github.com/angular/angular-seed — the seed for AngularJS apps

## Demo
Instances of this application are deployed here:

###
https://lotto.firebaseapp.com/

Only static Firebase app hosting functionality is used, the FB database is not involved, that is covered by DynamoDB.

Another location where you can host it for free is simply Google Drive, follow hints from here: https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2881970?hl=en
That Google Drive hosting is surprisingly robust!

## AWS Free Tier
The application is eligible for AWS Free Tier:

http://aws.amazon.com/free/

The free tier for the services used remains available indefinitely, not only during the first 12 months!

## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone the lotto repository and install the dependencies:

### Prerequisites

You need git to clone the lotto repository. You can get git from
[http://git-scm.com/](http://git-scm.com/).

We also use a number of node.js tools to initialize and test lotto. You must have node.js and
its package manager (npm) installed.  You can get them from [http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/).

### Clone lotto

Clone the lotto repository using [git][git]:

```
git clone https://github.com/doodeck/lotto.git
cd lotto
```

If you just want to start a new project without the lotto/angular-seed commit history then you can do:

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/doodeck/lotto.git <your-project-name>
```

The `depth=1` tells git to only pull down one commit worth of historical data.

### Install Dependencies

We have two kinds of dependencies in this project: tools and angular framework code.  The tools help
us manage and test the application.

* We get the tools we depend upon via `npm`, the [node package manager][npm].
* We get the angular code via `bower`, a [client-side code package manager][bower].

We have preconfigured `npm` to automatically run `bower` so we can simply do:

```
npm install
```

Behind the scenes this will also call `bower install`.  You should find that you have two new
folders in your project.

* `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the tools we need
* `app/bower_components` - contains the angular framework files

*Note that the `bower_components` folder would normally be installed in the root folder but
lotto changes this location through the `.bowerrc` file.  Putting it in the app folder makes
it easier to serve the files by a webserver.*

### Create AWS Cognito identity pool
Open AWS Console, select Cognito module.

Click "New Identity Pool". Enter the Identity Pool Name of your choice, e.g. "LambdaRandom". Check the box "Enable Access to Unauthenticated Identities". Click "Create Pool". On the next page leave all the defaults, click "Update Roles".
On the next page you'll see the sampel code for Android, iOS and .NET. Copy/Paste the unique id's into app.js/config/cognito/AccountId:|IdentityPoolId:|RoleArn. Do not copy the authenticated role name (e.g. "Cognito_LambdaRandomAuth_DefaultRole"), this is not used.

In AWS xonsole open IAM module. Edit the roles. Edit the unathenticated role (e.g. "Cognito_LambdaRandomUnauth_DefaultRole") you have just created. In the Permissions section click "Attach Role Policy". Depending on your experience and personal preferences go through either "Policy Generator" or "Custom Policy". Create a policy with selected read-only access to the DynamoDB database, e.g.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "Stmt1419606489000",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "dynamodb:DescribeTable",
        "dynamodb:Scan",
        "dynamodb:Query"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:dynamodb:eu-west-1:915133436062:table/LambdaRandom",
        "arn:aws:dynamodb:eu-west-1:915133436062:table/Lotto_*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Note, there is a script create-function.sh, which is creating the function. However, it assumes that the necessary AWS role has already been created and must be specified on the command line.

Also, there is a function removal script delete-function.sh, which can also serve as an emergency break to stop the execution of lambda.

### Run the Application

We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server.  The simplest way to start
this server is:

```
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at `http://localhost:8000/app/index.html`.

### System Clock

Note that's it's vitally important to have the local clock on the client synchronized to the authoritative clock source. Hving the clock skewed by more that 5 minutes would result in error messages similar to:

```
Error: Signature expired: 20150208T081000Z is now earlier than 20150208T081654Z (20150208T082154Z - 5 min.)
```

## Testing

There are two kinds of tests in the lotto application: Unit tests and End to End tests. These tests were not updated when migrating the code from angular-seed though, probably a good idea for issues list :-).

### Running Unit Tests

The lotto app comes preconfigured with unit tests. These are written in [Jasmine][jasmine], which we run with the [Karma Test Runner][karma]. We provide a Karma configuration file to run them.

* the configuration is found at `karma.conf.js`
* the unit tests are found next to the code they are testing and are named as `..._test.js`.

The easiest way to run the unit tests is to use the supplied npm script:

```
npm test
```

This script will start the Karma test runner to execute the unit tests. Moreover, Karma will sit and
watch the source and test files for changes and then re-run the tests whenever any of them change.
This is the recommended strategy; if your unit tests are being run every time you save a file then
you receive instant feedback on any changes that break the expected code functionality.

You can also ask Karma to do a single run of the tests and then exit.  This is useful if you want to
check that a particular version of the code is operating as expected.  The project contains a
predefined script to do this:

```
npm run test-single-run
```


### End to end testing

The lotto app comes with end-to-end tests, again written in [Jasmine][jasmine]. These tests
are run with the [Protractor][protractor] End-to-End test runner.  It uses native events and has
special features for Angular applications.

* the configuration is found at `e2e-tests/protractor-conf.js`
* the end-to-end tests are found in `e2e-tests/scenarios.js`

Protractor simulates interaction with our web app and verifies that the application responds
correctly. Therefore, our web server needs to be serving up the application, so that Protractor
can interact with it.

```
npm start
```

In addition, since Protractor is built upon WebDriver we need to install this.  The lotto
project comes with a predefined script to do this:

```
npm run update-webdriver
```

This will download and install the latest version of the stand-alone WebDriver tool.

Once you have ensured that the development web server hosting our application is up and running
and WebDriver is updated, you can run the end-to-end tests using the supplied npm script:

```
npm run protractor
```

This script will execute the end-to-end tests against the application being hosted on the
development server.


## Updating Angular

Now that the angular framework library code and tools are acquired through package managers (npm and
bower) you can use these tools instead to update the dependencies.

You can update the tool dependencies by running:

```
npm update
```

This will find the latest versions that match the version ranges specified in the `package.json` file.

You can update the Angular dependencies by running:

```
bower update
```

This will find the latest versions that match the version ranges specified in the `bower.json` file.


## Loading Angular Asynchronously

The lotto project supports loading the framework and application scripts asynchronously. The special `index-async.html` is designed to support this style of loading.  For it to work you must inject a piece of Angular JavaScript into the HTML page.  The project has a predefined script to help
do this.

```
npm run update-index-async
```

This will copy the contents of the `angular-loader.js` library file into the `index-async.html` page.
You can run this every time you update the version of Angular that you are using.


## Serving the Application Files

While angular is client-side-only technology and it's possible to create angular webapps that
don't require a backend server at all, we recommend serving the project files using a local
webserver during development to avoid issues with security restrictions (sandbox) in browsers. The
sandbox implementation varies between browsers, but quite often prevents things like cookies, xhr,
etc to function properly when an html page is opened via `file://` scheme instead of `http://`.


### Running the App during Development

The lotto project comes preconfigured with a local development webserver.  It is a node.js
tool called [http-server][http-server].  You can start this webserver with `npm start` but you may choose to
install the tool globally:

```
sudo npm install -g http-server
```

Then you can start your own development web server to serve static files from a folder by
running:

```
http-server -a localhost -p 8000
```

Alternatively, you can choose to configure your own webserver, such as apache or nginx. Just
configure your server to serve the files under the `app/` directory.


### Running the App in Production

This really depends on how complex your app is and the overall infrastructure of your system, but
the general rule is that all you need in production are all the files under the `app/` directory.
Everything else should be omitted.

Angular apps are really just a bunch of static html, css and js files that just need to be hosted
somewhere they can be accessed by browsers.

If your Angular app is talking to the backend server via xhr or other means, you need to figure
out what is the best way to host the static files to comply with the same origin policy if
applicable. Usually this is done by hosting the files by the backend server or through
reverse-proxying the backend server(s) and webserver(s).
